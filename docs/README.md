# Project3
Running this code requires the user to have SFML 3.0 and Boost installed.

Additionally, the user must download the following chess puzzle database:
https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles
The file comes in a compressed format, which can be decompressed differently depending on OS
Windows:
Right clicking the file and extracting via 7Zip should decompress the file and return the .csv file

macOS:
zstd can be installed via homebrew (in terminal enter "brew install zstd")
To decompress the file, run this in terminal:
zstd --decompress path/to/file.zst
This will return the .csv file

The .csv file can then be placed in Project3/data/

To run the program, run the Main configuration and the user interface will prompt usage.
